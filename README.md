# Welcome to The Rig Veda Project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lov-rigveda.vercel.app
This project is hosted via Render. As I'm currently on free tier, Render automatically shuts down my backend due to inactivity and thus the website is unable to make continuous API requests. If you encounter blank page please refresh or close the tab and reopen after 10-20 sec. This is the only fix, until this project receives some generous contributions.

## Resources used

The major resource used extensively for this project is [VedaWeb](https://lov-rigveda.vercel.app/) which is an Online Research Platform for Old Indic Texts. I have utilised the english transliterations, english translations, hymn deity, meter and various grammar info provided by it for my website.
